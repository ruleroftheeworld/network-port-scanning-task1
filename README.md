# 🔐 Cybersecurity Internship – Task 1: Network Port Scanning

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates basic network reconnaissance using **Nmap**, **Wireshark**, and a custom **UDP server**. It includes scans on localhost and local networks, service detection, packet analysis, and manual UDP service simulation.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Kali Linux (VirtualBox)**
- **Nmap** – TCP SYN & UDP scans
- **Wireshark** – Packet filtering & analysis
---

## ✅ Task Summary

- Performed port scans on localhost and network (e.g. `192.168.56.0/24`)
- Simulated HTTP & UDP services on open ports
- Scanned and identified active hosts and common services
- Analyzed captured traffic using Wireshark filters (`tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0`)
- Exported Nmap results to XML and converted to HTML for reporting
